# Twitty Little Words FAQ

## Q. What's with the name?

A. I dunno, it just sounded distinctive. The sounds twitter.

## Q. What dictionary is used?

A. The offical Scrabble dictionary is copyright (possibly of Collins). Instead Twitty uses two dictionaries: a large one and a small one for the hints and ROBOTO.

## Q. Why do the tiles not show the letter scores on them, like in Scrabble?

A. Because this shouldn't look so much like Scrabble that the Scrabble lawyers start writing to me.

## Q. How does the game against the robot end?

A. You get a turn, then the robot gets a turn. After these two turns, if either score is greater than or equal to 420, the game ends and the winner declared.

## Q. Why is shuffle free?

A. Because (a) the tiles were randomly shuffled to start with, and (b) everytime the tiles are shuffled you have to rescan the grid and learn the new patterns, whcih takes time and effort.

## Q. Why only one hint per game?

A. Why have any hints at all?

## Q. Hints and tips

A. Make long words, because the score is calculated to be (the sum of all the letter values in the word) x (the length of the word).
Make long words using the high value letters (especially Q, X and Z), even if it means swapping a few letters first.
For example, 'SEPTEMBER' is worth 135 points, so even of you 'spend' 35 points swapping letters into place, you will still score 100 for a word.

## Q. The score at the end isn't the same as the score shown during the game

A. In the CASUAL and URGENT modes, the value of the letters left on the grid are deducted from the final score.
