# Twitty Little Words FAQ

## Q. What's with the name?

A. I dunno, it just sounded distinctive. The sounds twitter.

## Q. What dictionary is used?

A. The offical Scrabble dictionary is copyright (possibly of Collins). Instead Twitty uses two dictionaries: a large one and a small one for the hints and ROBOTO.

## Q. Why do the tiles not show the letter scores on them, like in Scrabble?

A. Because this shouldn't look so much like Scrabble that the Scrabble lawyers start writing to me.
