I started out to write a falling-block/matching-tile game which generated random musical melodies. It morphed into a Scrabble trainer, with underlying evil elements drawn from the real world to subtly test, confound and unnerve the player:

The hint system is deliberately disappointing and of limited use. It's throttled to three uses per grid; it uses a much smaller dictionary; it contains just word roots (eg BOX) so you have to find longer words (BOXES, BOXED, BOXING); you won't get a very high score using it.

Letter swaps are limited, too. You start with one, and gain one per word found. You can only swap adjacent letters. Or, you can press the SWAP button and have all the letters randomly rearranged.

You have to choose between saving the swaps for later or using them now.

You have to compromise when using the high value tiles (Q and Z) now or save them for later.

The dictionary (Collins 2019 Scrabble) contains obscure words for you to discover. You're not told what the obscure words mean.

The user interface contains things for you to explore (eg SWAP and SCORE are buttons). It's not immediately clear how you 'finish'.

The high score table taunts you with a record of 1000.

If you use a blank tile, you're not told what the tile stood for.

The mode names on the opening menu are obtuse.

In the timed and untimed modes, the value of the remaining tiles is quietly deducted from your score with no warning. I was doing my taxes when I thought of that.

The sound effects are largely random; drive yourself mad trying to give them meaning.
