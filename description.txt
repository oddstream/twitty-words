The hint system is deliberately disappointing and of limited use. It's use is throttled to three uses per grid; it uses a much smaller dictionary; it contains just word roots (eg BOX) so you have to find longer words (BOXES, BOXED, BOXING); you won't get a very high score using it.

Do you save the swaps for alter or use them now

Do you use the high value tiles (Q and Z) now or save them for later

The dictionary contains obscure words for you to learn

The user interface contains things for you to explore (swap and score are buttons)

The high score table taunts you with a record of 1000

If you use a blank tile, you're not told what the tile stood for
